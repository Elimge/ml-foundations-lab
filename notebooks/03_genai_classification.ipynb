    "In previous notebooks, we:\n",
    "- Generated a synthetic dataset\n",
    "- Trained and evaluated a classical Logistic Regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take a different perspective:\n",
    "- No training phase is required\n",
    "- The model relies entirely on prompt engineering and reasoning\n",
    "- Predictions are generated dynamically via an external LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Define an ambiguous fruit sample\n",
    "2. Query a local LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama)\n",
    "3. Analyze the model’s reasoning, confidence, and latency\n",

    "This experiment helps illustrate when and why GenAI may (or may not) be appropriate for classification tasks.\n"

    "Key characteristics of this approach:\n",
    "- The LLM has **no access to the dataset**\n",

    "- The output includes both a prediction and an explanation\n",
